# SerialKiller2 Script Synchronization Guide

This guide provides multiple solutions for synchronizing the execution of two SerialKiller2 scripts on different ports, reducing the typical 0.3-1 second offset to just a few milliseconds.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Recommended Solution)

### Option 1: PowerShell Script (Best Precision)

1. **Edit the configuration** in `sync_scripts.ps1`:
   ```powershell
   # Edit these lines at the top of sync_scripts.ps1
   $HelmholtzPort = "COM3"           # Your Helmholtz chamber port
   $SatellitePort = "COM4"           # Your satellite port  
   $HelmholtzScript = "scripts/helmholtz_script.txt"
   $SatelliteScript = "scripts/satellite_script.txt"
   ```

2. **Run the synchronizer**:
   ```powershell
   .\sync_scripts.ps1
   ```

**Expected Result**: Both scripts start within 5-20ms of each other.

## 📋 All Available Solutions

### Option 1: PowerShell Synchronization (★★★★★)
- **Precision**: 5-20ms offset
- **Platform**: Windows only
- **Requirements**: PowerShell (built into Windows)
- **Setup**: Edit `sync_scripts.ps1` with your ports and script paths

```powershell
# Run with custom parameters
.\sync_scripts.ps1 -HelmholtzPort COM5 -SatellitePort COM6
```

### Option 2: Python Synchronization (★★★★☆)
- **Precision**: 10-50ms offset  
- **Platform**: Cross-platform
- **Requirements**: Python 3.6+
- **Setup**: Edit variables in `sync_scripts.py`

```bash
python sync_scripts.py
```

### Option 3: Batch File Synchronization (★★★☆☆)
- **Precision**: 20-100ms offset
- **Platform**: Windows only
- **Requirements**: None (built into Windows)
- **Setup**: Edit variables in `sync_scripts.bat`

```cmd
sync_scripts.bat
```

### Option 4: Manual Command Line (★★★☆☆)
- **Precision**: 50-200ms offset
- **Platform**: Any
- **Requirements**: Multiple terminal windows

Open two terminals and run simultaneously:
```bash
# Terminal 1 (Helmholtz)
python SK.py -c "con COM3" "script -o scripts/helmholtz_script.txt" "script"

# Terminal 2 (Satellite) 
python SK.py -c "con COM4" "script -o scripts/satellite_script.txt" "script"
```

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Identify Your COM Ports
First, find your device COM ports:

```bash
# In SerialKiller2, run:
ports
```

### 2. Prepare Your Script Files
Make sure your script files exist in the `scripts/` directory:
- `scripts/helmholtz_script.txt`
- `scripts/satellite_script.txt`

### 3. Configure the Synchronizer
Edit the synchronization script of your choice with the correct:
- COM port numbers
- Script file paths

### 4. Test the Setup
Run a test to ensure both devices connect properly:

```bash
# Test individual connections first
python SK.py -c "con COM3"  # Test Helmholtz
python SK.py -c "con COM4"  # Test Satellite
```

## 🎯 Advanced Synchronization (Future Enhancement)

For sub-millisecond precision, I've created `SK_sync.py` which can be integrated into SerialKiller2 to add network-based synchronization commands:

### Script Commands (Future Feature):
```
@sync-master          # Designate as master instance
@sync-client          # Designate as client instance  
@sync-wait start      # Wait for start signal
@sync-signal ready    # Send ready signal
@sync-point test1     # Synchronization checkpoint
```

### Implementation:
This would require modifying SerialKiller2's script engine to recognize sync commands and coordinate execution across network.

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Script file not found"
**Solution**: Check that your script files exist in the correct paths:
```bash
# Verify files exist
dir scripts\helmholtz_script.txt
dir scripts\satellite_script.txt
```

### Problem: "Port not found" 
**Solution**: Check available ports in SerialKiller2:
```bash
python SK.py -c "ports"
```

### Problem: PowerShell execution policy error
**Solution**: Run PowerShell as Administrator and execute:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

### Problem: Both instances connect to same port
**Solution**: Double-check your port configurations in the sync script. Each instance needs a unique COM port.

### Problem: Scripts don't auto-run
**Solution**: Ensure your script files are in the correct format and contain valid SerialKiller2 commands.

## 🔍 Verification 

To verify synchronization is working:

1. **Check the timing output** from the sync scripts
2. **Look for simultaneous responses** from both devices
3. **Use logging** to capture exact timestamps:
   ```bash
   # Add to your scripts for timestamp logging
   @info=Script started at $(date)
   ```

4. **Monitor serial traffic** on both ports simultaneously

---

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

1. **Close other applications** that might use serial ports
2. **Use dedicated USB ports** (avoid USB hubs if possible)  
3. **Test the sync script** before critical measurements
4. **Keep scripts simple** during synchronized execution
5. **Add error handling** to your test scripts:
   ```
   @timeout=5000
   @exitcmd=con disconnect
   ```

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check that both devices are connected and responsive
2. Verify COM port assignments haven't changed
3. Test individual SerialKiller2 instances first
4. Check Windows Device Manager for port conflicts

The PowerShell solution (`sync_scripts.ps1`) provides the best balance of precision and ease of use for most testing scenarios.
